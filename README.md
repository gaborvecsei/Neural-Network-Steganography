# Hiding Secrets and Malware in Neural Networks - NN Steganography

Hide some secret data in a Neural Network - text, malicious software or watermark your NN.
(As long as you can convert it to bytes, you can hide it.)

A neural network usually contains many parameters which are represented as floating point numbers
(generally 32bit floats). We can modify the bits of the parameters to hide data in the neural network with no or just
a small degradation of the metric (e.g.: accuracy) used to evaluate the NN.
